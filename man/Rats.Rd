\description{
Teratology experiment investigating effects of dietary regimens or chemical agents on the fetal
development of rats in a laboratory setting. The experiment, as describred in Agresti (2015, Section 8.2.4),
regards female rats on iron-deficient diets, assigned to four groups. Rats in group 1 were given placebo
injections, and rats in other groups were given injections of an iron supplement.
This was done on days 7 and 10 in group 2, on days 0 and 7 in group 3, and weekly in group 4.
The 58 rats were made pregnant, sacrificed after 3 weeks, and then the total number of dead fetuses
was counted in each litter, as was the motherâ€™s hemoglobin level.
